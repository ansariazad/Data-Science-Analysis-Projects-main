# 📚 Data Science & Machine Learning Analysis Projects

This repository documents the work completed in data analysis, data handling, and preprocessing.

Each subdirectory is organized by project topic and contains a Jupyter Notebook, a dedicated `README.md` with a summary of the project's focus, and references to necessary data files.

* The data files used are free, publicly available datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or public repositories) and are located in the dedicated **`Datasets/`** folder.
